This repository includes 2 datasets, winequality-red.csv and windquality-white.csv, inside the data folder. There is also a red_wine_quality_prediction_model.ipynb which is an .ipynb that uses linear regression, lasso, and decision tree to predict the quality of red wine along with surface. All three predictions using the three models are subpar to say the least. Another model will be created for the white wine dataset which will most likely be identical to the red_wine_quality_prediction_model.ipynb. red_wine_quality_prediction_model.ipynb will be updated with comments. More models may or may not be added.
